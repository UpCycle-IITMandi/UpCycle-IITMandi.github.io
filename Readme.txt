Village Square - Stealth Mode Startup

We are building a hyperlocal marketplace in the form of an Android-based 
platform which lists all vendors and services available, allowing
users to browse through them and place orders. Along with it, there
will be 2nd hand goods listed on the application in the form of
classifieds. Students can set up there on own shops and register
themselves as freelancers/service providers, contributing and earning.

Therefore, for hostel students of a remote college, who have a limited
and unstructured market, our application "Village Square" is a
hyperlocal marketplace in the form of an android-based application
that is a one-stop medium to access the entire local market, making the
process seamless and hassle-free.
